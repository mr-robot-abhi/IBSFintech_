# IBSFINtech Awards System

## Overview
The awards system has been completely restructured from a popup-based system to individual, SEO-optimized pages for each award. This provides better user experience, improved SEO, and better accessibility.

## Structure

### Main Awards Page
- **Location**: `/app/awards/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays all awards organized by year with filtering capabilities
- **Features**: 
  - Year-based filtering
  - Grid layout for awards
  - Links to individual award pages instead of popups

### Individual Award Pages
- **Location**: `/app/awards/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for each award with full content
- **Features**:
  - SEO-optimized URLs using slugs
  - Full award content display
  - Proper meta tags and structured data
  - Responsive design

### Data Management
- **Location**: `/app/awards/data.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized data store for all awards
- **Features**:
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Organized by year
  - SEO-friendly slugs for routing
  - Helper functions for data access

### SEO Components
- **Layout**: `/app/awards/[slug]/layout.tsx`
  - Dynamic meta tags generation
  - Structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines
  - Open Graph and Twitter Card support

- **Sitemaps**: 
  - `/app/sitemap.ts` - Main site sitemap including awards
  - `/app/awards/sitemap.ts` - Awards-specific sitemap
  - `/app/robots.ts` - Robots.txt for search engine guidance

## URL Structure

### Before (Popup System)
- All award details were shown in modal popups
- No individual URLs for awards
- Poor SEO performance

### After (Individual Pages)
- Main awards page: `/awards`
- Individual award pages: `/awards/[slug]`
- Example: `/awards/asset-triple-treasurise-awards-2023`

## SEO Benefits

### 1. Individual URLs
- Each award gets its own page with a unique URL
- Better for social sharing and bookmarking
- Improved search engine indexing

### 2. Meta Tags
- Dynamic title and description for each award
- Proper keywords and Open Graph tags
- Twitter Card optimization

### 3. Structured Data

- Rich snippets in search results
- Better understanding by search engines

### 4. Sitemap Integration
- All award pages included in sitemap
- Proper priority and change frequency settings
- Better crawlability

## Content Types

The system supports various content types for awards:

```typescript
type ContentItem = 
  | { type: 'heading'; text: string }
  | { type: 'text'; text: string }
  | { type: 'quote'; text: string; author: string }
  | { type: 'list'; items: string[] };
```

## Adding New Awards

### 1. Update Data File
Add new award to `/app/awards/data.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 28,
  year: 2024,
  title: 'New Award Title',
  description: 'Award description',
  imageUrl: '/path/to/image.jpg',
  event: 'Event Name',
  slug: 'new-award-title-2024', // SEO-friendly slug
  readMoreContent: [
    // Content items...
  ]
}
```

### 2. Slug Naming Convention

- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Include year for uniqueness
- Keep it descriptive but concise

### 3. Content Structure
- Use headings for major sections
- Include quotes from clients/partners
